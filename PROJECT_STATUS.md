# Project Status - Obsidian AI Agent

**Status:** Paused (Good stopping point for future local LLM integration)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25
**Version:** 3.2.5

## Current State

### What Works ‚úÖ

**Core Agent System:**
- Agent loop with tool calling (OpenAI API)
- System prompt with 5-pillar architecture
- Per-query reasoning effort control (low/medium/high)
- Token usage tracking and cost estimation
- Proper prompt caching support

**Semantic Search (RAG System):**
- OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
- Local vector storage in IndexedDB
- MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) for diverse results
- Per-file chunk limits to avoid over-representation
- Smart indexing with progress tracking

**Read Tools:**
- `list_files` - enumerate files with filters (folder/tag/pattern), pagination, count mode
- `read_file` - read full file content with budget tracking
- `retrieve_relevant_chunks` - semantic search via embeddings
- `search_lexical` - coming soon (not yet implemented)
- `send_status` - LLM-driven status updates for user feedback
- `output_to_user` - present final answer

**UI/UX:**
- Chat interface with Grammar UI rendering
- Left-aligned status messages (no center alignment)
- No emojis - Lucide icons only via Grammar components
- Merged thinking/tool call status into single updating block
- Fade-in animations for responses (0.2s, 6px translateY)
- Debug mode toggle for technical details
- Settings panel with Grammar UI test sandbox
- Reasoning effort and verbosity dropdowns

**Grammar UI Integration:**
- Complete rendering (no progressive streaming - that broke syntax)
- Console logging for debugging output
- Custom action callbacks
- Supports all Grammar components (grid, button, card, etc.)

### What's Incomplete ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Read Capability: B Grade**
- Works but could be more reliable
- Sometimes clunky responses
- Accuracy can vary

**Write Tools: Not Implemented**
- No file creation
- No file editing
- No file deletion
- No note manipulation

**Command Tools: Not Implemented**
- No workspace manipulation
- No view creation
- No command palette integration
- No hotkeys
- No right-click menu items
- No status bar integration

**UI Issues:**
- Still feels slightly clunky in places
- Animation timing could be more refined
- Status updates sometimes redundant (improved in 3.2.5 but not perfect)

### Known Issues üêõ

1. **Grammar Rendering:** Fixed in 3.2.5 (was breaking with progressive streaming)
2. **Status Update Spam:** Improved in 3.2.5 (limited send_status to complex operations only)
3. **UI Responsiveness:** Animation reduced to 0.2s but could be snappier
4. **Result Accuracy:** System prompt improved in 3.2.5 but still B-grade

## Architecture Overview

```
Obsidian Plugin
  ‚îú‚îÄ ChatView (UI)
  ‚îú‚îÄ SettingsTab
  ‚îú‚îÄ ContextBuilder (5 Pillars)
  ‚îú‚îÄ AgentLoop (orchestration)
  ‚îú‚îÄ APIHandler (OpenAI)
  ‚îú‚îÄ ToolManager (tool execution)
  ‚îî‚îÄ RAGSystem (semantic search)
```

**Key Files:**
- `main.js` - all code (monolithic, ~3100 lines)
- `styles.css` - UI styling
- `manifest.json` - plugin metadata
- `pillar1-static.txt` - tool use instructions (read-only)
- `pillar5-static.txt` - completion criteria

## Next Steps If Resuming

### Near-term (Finish Current Scope)
1. Fix remaining read reliability issues
2. Implement write tools (create_file, update_file, delete_file)
3. Add command tools (workspace manipulation)
4. Polish UI responsiveness
5. Improve result accuracy to A-grade

### Long-term (Local LLM Integration) üéØ
This is the compelling differentiator vs MCP approach.

**Why Local Models Matter:**
- Complete privacy (zero data leaves network)
- No API costs after hardware investment
- Deep Obsidian integration (no context switching)
- Fine-tuning on personal notes possible

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Abstract AI provider interface (OpenAI vs Local)
2. Add Ollama-compatible endpoint support
3. Local embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, etc.)
4. Model selection in settings (small/fast vs large/accurate)
5. Support for unRAID server deployment

**Hardware Considerations:**
- Requires GPU for reasonable performance
- unRAID server with GPU passthrough ideal
- Models: Llama 3.1, Qwen, Mistral, etc.

### Alternative Approach: MCP Server
For users who don't need deep integration, an MCP server + Obsidian API plugin provides:
- Full read/write vault access
- Better maintained chat UI (Claude Desktop)
- Automatic model updates
- Multi-provider support

**But lacks:**
- In-Obsidian workflow (context switching required)
- Grammar UI richness
- Local/offline model support
- Event-driven features

## Project Vision

**Original Goal:** AI assistant deeply integrated into Obsidian workflow

**Current Reality:** Working but incomplete read-only agent with decent UX

**Future Vision:** Privacy-first AI augmentation with local models, deep workspace integration, and event-driven features that MCP can't provide

## Why Paused

More important projects with better ROI:
1. Personal house construction
2. Business ventures (laser hat burning, etc.)

**Decision:** Pause at good stopping point. Can resume later if local LLM integration becomes compelling.

## How to Resume

1. Check out this branch: `claude/fix-status-text-formatting-011CUPBecZ94DjDdKypvCacM`
2. Review this document
3. Test current functionality
4. Decide: finish current scope or jump to local LLM integration
5. Consider whether MCP approach is better for your actual use case

**Bottom Line:** Solid foundation, good pausing point, clear path forward for local LLM integration when ready.
