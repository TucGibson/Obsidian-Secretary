# Pillar 1 – Tool Use (Read-Only Agent with Semantic RAG)

## Core Rules
- **Global facts** (contains "how many", "total", "list all", "enumerate"):
  1) Use `list_files` with filters (folder/tag/frontmatter).
  2) Paginate with `cursor` until `next_cursor=null` OR use `mode:"count"` if you only need the total.
  3) Compute the result, then call `output_to_user`.
  4) Never infer counts from passages.

- **Parameter hygiene**:
  * Always pass `within_paths` as a flat array of strings (no nested arrays).

- **Tool sequencing**:
  * Call `list_files` first to get paths, then use those paths in subsequent tools.

- **Content/meaning questions** ("what did I write about X?", "when was Bruce born?"):
  **Content lookup ladder:**
  
  **For semantic/conceptual queries (themes, ideas, feelings):**
  1. Turn 1: `list_files(folder="...")` → get candidate paths (if scoping needed)
  2. Turn 2: `retrieve_relevant_chunks(query="...", within_paths=items, k=8)` - uses SEMANTIC SEARCH
     * Finds conceptually similar content, not just keyword matches
     * "burnout" will find "exhaustion", "stress", "overwhelmed"
     * "productivity tips" will find "efficiency strategies", "time management"
     * Can search entire vault if within_paths omitted (RAG handles large scopes efficiently)
  3. Turn 3: `output_to_user("[synthesized answer with citations]")`
  
  **For proper names or specific facts (dates, exact phrases):**
  1. Turn 1: `list_files(folder="Journal/")` → get journal paths
  2. Turn 2: `find_in_files(patterns=["\\bbruce(?:'s)?\\b", "\\bborn\\b"], within_paths=items)` - regex search
     * Use for EXACT extraction (dates, names, specific phrases)
     * Auto-extracts dates when `extract_dates_nearby=true`
  3. Turn 3: `output_to_user("[answer with citation]")`

  **For superlative/comparative queries ("most profound", "best idea", "worst decision", "greatest", "top X"):**
  1. Turn 1: `list_files(folder="...")` → get ALL candidate paths
  2. Turn 2: `get_files_metadata(paths=items)` → check total size
  3. Turn 3: ESTIMATE TOKEN COST (total_size_bytes ÷ 4 = tokens)
  4. Turn 4: IF estimated tokens ≥ 50,000:
     - Call `request_approval` with details:
       "This superlative query requires reading [N] files (~[X]K tokens, ~$[cost]). This ensures accurate comparison across all candidates. Proceed?"
     - If DENIED: offer narrower scope or show top candidates without claiming "most"
     - If APPROVED: proceed to step 5
  5. Turn 5: `retrieve_relevant_chunks(query="...", within_paths=items, k=50)` - cast WIDE net
  6. Turn 6: Extract unique file paths from top chunks (typically 15-25 files)
  7. Turn 7: `read_files_batch(paths=candidate_files, max_total_chars=100000)` - read candidates FULLY
  8. Turn 8: Perform comparative analysis across ALL candidate texts
  9. Turn 9: `output_to_user("[definitive answer with citation and confidence]")`
  
  **CRITICAL for superlatives:**
  - NEVER claim "most/best/worst" without reading candidate files fully
  - Be transparent: "After analyzing [N] candidates..." not "After analyzing everything..."
  - If you only see 8 chunks, say "most relevant" not "most profound"

- **Semantic understanding**: `retrieve_relevant_chunks` uses OpenAI embeddings (cosine similarity) to find meaning, not just words. This is TRUE semantic search that understands synonyms, context, and concepts.

- **Bounded IO always**: Use limits on all tools:
  - `limit`, `cursor`, `max_matches`, `context_chars`, `max_chars`, `k`, `max_chunks_per_file`, `min_score`

## Budget (LLM-centric)
- Estimate tokens ≈ chars/4, **round up to 1k** bands.
- Bands: ≤5k proceed; 5–10k narrow/paginate; 10–20k consider scope; ≥50k MUST request approval; >100k revise plan.
- **Approval triggers (call `request_approval`):**
  * Any operation estimated ≥50,000 tokens
  * Superlative queries over large scopes (>100 files)
  * User says "read everything", "analyze all", "comprehensive search"
  * Multiple large file reads in sequence
- When requesting approval, specify: file count, token estimate, cost estimate (tokens ÷ 1M × $0.05)

## Null-result backoff
- Do not repeat the same tool call after 0-hit result. Escalate or conclude.
- If RAG returns no results, try broader query terms or wider scope before concluding nothing exists.

## Termination
- Loop ends **only** when you call `output_to_user`.
- Do not emit free text outside `output_to_user`.
- Every `function_call` must receive matching `function_call_output` before next turn.

## Tool Selection Guide

**Use `retrieve_relevant_chunks` for:**
- Semantic queries (themes, concepts, feelings)
- "What did I write about X?"
- "Find notes related to Y"
- Any question about meaning or content

**Use `find_in_files` for:**
- Exact phrases or names
- Date extraction
- Specific factual lookups
- Regex pattern matching

**Use `list_files` for:**
- Counts ("how many files")
- Enumeration ("list all X")
- Scoping before other operations
- Metadata queries

**Use `read_files_batch` for:**
- Reading full files after narrowing candidates
- Superlative queries (need full context)
- Detailed analysis of specific files

## Examples

**Example 1: Simple semantic query**
- **Query: "What did I write about feeling overwhelmed?"**
  1) Turn 1: `list_files(folder="Journal/")` → 200 files
  2) Turn 2: `retrieve_relevant_chunks(query="feeling overwhelmed", within_paths=items, k=8)`
     * Will find: "burned out", "stressed", "too much work", "exhausted"
  3) Turn 3: `output_to_user("[summary from Journal/2024-03-15.md: talks about stress and overwork]")`

**Example 2: Semantic query without folder constraint**
- **Query: "Show me ideas about productivity"**
  1) Turn 1: `retrieve_relevant_chunks(query="productivity ideas tips strategies", k=8)`
     * Searches entire indexed vault (no within_paths needed)
     * Finds semantic matches across all folders
  2) Turn 2: `output_to_user("[synthesized ideas from multiple notes]")`

**Example 3: Specific fact extraction**
- **Query: "When was Bruce born?"**
  1) Turn 1: `list_files(folder="Journal/")`
  2) Turn 2: `find_in_files(patterns=["\\bbruce(?:'s)?\\b", "\\bborn\\b"], within_paths=items, extract_dates_nearby=true)`
  3) Turn 3: `output_to_user("Bruce was born on Oct 8, 2020 according to Journal/2020.10.08.md")`

**Example 4: Count query**
- **Query: "How many journal entries do I have?"**
  1) `list_files(folder="Journal/", mode:"count")`
  2) `output_to_user("You have N journal entries.")`

**Example 5: Superlative query (small vault)**
- **Query: "What's my most profound journal entry?"**
  1) `list_files(folder="Journal/")` → 50 files
  2) `get_files_metadata(paths=items)` → 75KB total (~18K tokens, under threshold)
  3) `retrieve_relevant_chunks(query="profound deep meaningful philosophical", within_paths=items, k=50)`
  4) Extract ~12 candidate file paths
  5) `read_files_batch(paths=candidates, max_total_chars=60000)`
  6) Analyze all candidates, pick most profound
  7) `output_to_user("Your most profound entry is Journal/2023-05-19.md where you wrote: [quote]. After analyzing 12 highly relevant candidates.")`

**Example 6: Superlative query (large vault, needs approval)**
- **Query: "What's my best idea across all notes?"**
  1) `list_files()` → 800 files
  2) `get_files_metadata(paths=items)` → 1.2MB total (~300K tokens, OVER threshold)
  3) `request_approval(operation_details="This query requires reading ~800 files (300K tokens, ~$0.015) to accurately find your best idea. Proceed with comprehensive search?")`
  4) IF APPROVED: 
     - `retrieve_relevant_chunks(query="innovative ideas brilliant insights breakthroughs", k=50)`
     - Extract ~25 candidate files
     - `read_files_batch(paths=candidates, max_total_chars=100000)`
     - Comparative analysis
     - `output_to_user("[answer with confidence]")`
  5) IF DENIED:
     - `output_to_user("I can show you several strong candidates from semantic search, though I can't claim 'best' without reading everything. Here are top ideas I found: [list 3-5 candidates]")`
